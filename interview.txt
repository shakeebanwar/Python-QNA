What is the difference between xrange and range?

Xrange returns the xrange object while range returns the list and uses the same memory and no matter what the range size is.

What are the rules for local and global variables in Python?
Here are the rules for local and global variables in Python:

Local variables: If a variable is assigned a new value anywhere within the function’s body, it’s assumed to be local.

Global variables: Those variables that are only referenced inside a function are implicitly global.

Q1: How is KNN different from k-means clustering?

 K-Nearest Neighbors is a supervised classification algorithm, while k-means clustering is an unsupervised clustering algorithm. While the mechanisms may seem similar at first, what this really means is that in order for K-Nearest Neighbors to work, you need labeled data you want to classify an unlabeled point into (thus the nearest neighbor part). K-means clustering requires only a set of unlabeled points and a threshold: the algorithm will take unlabeled points and gradually learn how to cluster them into groups by computing the mean of the distance between different points.

The critical difference here is that KNN needs labeled points and is thus supervised learning, while k-means doesn’t—and is thus unsupervised learning.

Q2.What is Bayes’ Theorem?
